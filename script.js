// Build an object representing a generic person
// It should have a name property and a method to say hello 


// Use Object.create() to create another object representing a specific person (it should use our generic person object as a prototype)



// Give our person their own name

// Call sayHello() on our new person 


// Do the same thing with JavaScript classes!
