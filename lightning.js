// LIGHTNING EXERCISE
// PATRONS
// 1. Create an object that represents a generic patron at a library
// 2. Your object should contain the following properties:
// - A name property (string)
// - A checkedOutBooks property (empty array)
// - A checkOutBook method, which should accept a bookObject as a parameter and push it into the patron's checkedOutBooks array 
// 3. Use Object.create() to create a few more specific patron objects who inherit properties from the object you created above. Give them their own unique name properties. 

// BOOKS
// 1. Create an object that represents a generic book in a library
// 2. Your object should contain a name property, an ISBN property, and a libraryLocation property (just give it the name of a made up library)
// 3. Use Object.create() to build a few more book objects that inherit properties from the object you created above. Give them their own unique title and ISBN properties.
// 4. Once you have a few books and a few patrons, try executing the checkOutBook method and passing in a book object. 


// LIGHTNING EXERCISE TWO
// 1. Rewrite your earlier code (or write it again) using JS class syntax rather than objects
